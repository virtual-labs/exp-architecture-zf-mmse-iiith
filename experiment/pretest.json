      "question": "What is the primary purpose of channel equalisation in wireless communication?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reduce noise levels in the received signal.",
        "b": "Reverse or compensate for the effects of the wireless channel on the signal.",
        "c": "Reduce transmission power.",
        "d": "Increase the transmission bandwidth."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – equalisation primarily deals with channel distortions, not just noise.",
        "b": "Correct – the goal is to reverse the channel's distortion effects.",
        "c": "Incorrect – equalisation does not affect transmit power.",
        "d": "Incorrect – it does not increase bandwidth."

      "question": "The Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer aims to:",

        "a": "Minimize noise power",
        "b": "Maximize signal-to-noise ratio",
        "c": "Completely eliminate inter-stream interference",
        "d": "Match the channel matrix"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – ZF does not focus on noise minimization.",
        "b": "Incorrect – ZF can degrade SNR due to noise amplification.",
        "c": "Correct – ZF attempts to nullify inter-stream interference entirely.",
        "d": "Incorrect – matching the channel is the role of a matched filter."

    {
      "question": "How does MMSE equalization differ from ZF equalization in terms of noise handling?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "MMSE minimizes mean square error but increases noise.",
        "b": "MMSE minimizes mean square error while balancing noise and ISI.",
        "c": "MMSE completely removes noise.",
        "d": "MMSE amplifies noise as channel gain approaches zero."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – MMSE balances noise and ISI instead of just minimizing error at the cost of noise.",
        "b": "Correct – MMSE trades off between removing interference and avoiding noise amplification.",
        "c": "Incorrect – no equalizer can completely remove noise.",
        "d": "Incorrect – this describes ZF behaviour, not MMSE."

      "question": "Which of the following equalizers considers noise power explicitly?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – ZF ignores noise.",
        "b": "Incorrect – matched filters do not explicitly account for noise power.",
        "c": "Correct – MMSE incorporates noise variance into its optimization.",
        "d": "Incorrect – DFE reduces ISI but does not directly factor noise into its design."

    {
      "question": "Which equalization method typically has better Bit Error Rate (BER) performance at low SNR levels?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Zero Forcing (ZF) Equalizer",
        "b": "MMSE Equalizer",

        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – ZF suffers more at low SNR due to noise amplification.",
        "b": "Correct – MMSE handles noise better at low SNR.",
        "c": "Incorrect – they differ significantly at low SNR.",
        "d": "Incorrect – MMSE is better in this scenario."
