      "question": "What is the primary purpose of channel equalization in wireless communication?",
      "answers": {
        "a": To reduce noise levels in the received signal",
        "b": " To reverse or compensate for the effects of the wireless channel on the signal",
        "c": "To reduce transmission power",
        "d": "To increase the transmission bandwidth"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Equalization aims to counteract channel-induced distortions like multipath fading to recover the original transmitted signal accurately.",
        "b": "Equalization aims to counteract channel-induced distortions like multipath fading to recover the original transmitted signal accurately.",
        "c": "Equalization aims to counteract channel-induced distortions like multipath fading to recover the original transmitted signal accurately.",
        "d": "Equalization aims to counteract channel-induced distortions like multipath fading to recover the original transmitted signal accurately."
