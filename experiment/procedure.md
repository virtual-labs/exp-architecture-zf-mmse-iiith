To analyze the performance of Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizers in mitigating noise and interference in wireless communication, please follow the following steps:
  1) Enter the input string.
  2) The transmitted signal goes through a multipath fading channel with AWGN. Observe the noisy received signal.
  3) Choose an equalizer:
     
      3.1) Zero-Forcing (ZF)
     
      3.2) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)
  4) The receiver applies the chosen equalizer to recover the transmitted signal.
  5) Compare the Bit Error Rate (BER) for ZF and MMSE and analyze which technique provides better signal recovery.
