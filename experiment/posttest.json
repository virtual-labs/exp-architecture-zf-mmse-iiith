      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. At high noise, MMSE and ZF differ significantly.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Signal power level alone doesn't cause MMSE to reduce to ZF.",
        "c": "Correct. As noise approaches zero, MMSE converges to ZF solution.",

      "question": "What is the effect of MMSE regularization compared to ZF?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces inter-symbol interference but increases complexity",

        "d": "It increases the condition number of the matrix"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Both MMSE and ZF address interference, but MMSE specifically regularizes to reduce noise amplification.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is just the Hermitian, not the full ZF equalizer.",
