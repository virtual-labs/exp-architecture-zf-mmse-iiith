      "question": "How does MMSE equalization differ from ZF equalization in terms of noise handling?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "MMSE minimizes mean square error but increases noise",
        "b": "MMSE minimizes mean square error while balancing noise and ISI",
        "c": "MMSE completely removes noise.",
        "d": "MMSE amplifies noise as channel gain"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Unlike ZF, MMSE equalization doesn’t simply invert the channel. It finds an optimal balance between minimizing ISI and controlling noise amplification.",
        "b": "Unlike ZF, MMSE equalization doesn’t simply invert the channel. It finds an optimal balance between minimizing ISI and controlling noise amplification.",
        "c": "Unlike ZF, MMSE equalization doesn’t simply invert the channel. It finds an optimal balance between minimizing ISI and controlling noise amplification.",
        "d": "Unlike ZF, MMSE equalization doesn’t simply invert the channel. It finds an optimal balance between minimizing ISI and controlling noise amplification."

      "question": "Which equalization method typically has better Bit Error Rate (BER) performance at low SNR levels?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "MMSE Equalizer",
        "b": "ZF equalizer",
        "c": "Both perform the same",
        "d": "None"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "MMSE is more robust at low SNRs because it minimizes the overall error, taking noise into account, whereas ZF often amplifies noise.",
        "b": "MMSE is more robust at low SNRs because it minimizes the overall error, taking noise into account, whereas ZF often amplifies noise.",
        "c": "MMSE is more robust at low SNRs because it minimizes the overall error, taking noise into account, whereas ZF often amplifies noise.",
