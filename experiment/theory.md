# Theory

In wideband wireless communication, a fundamental challenge is frequency-selective fading, which occurs when different frequency components of the transmitted signal experience varying levels of attenuation and delay due to the multipath nature of wireless channels. This phenomenon is particularly prominent when the transmission symbol duration is small or the transmission bandwidth is large, leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI). ISI results from overlapping symbols in time, which can significantly degrade the performance of the communication system by causing errors in symbol detection.

To address ISI in frequency-selective fading channels, several techniques are commonly employed, including:
  1) Channel Equalization - Using equalizers to reverse the effects of the channel and recover the transmitted signal. 
  2) Multi-Carrier Modulation - Splitting the signal into multiple subcarriers to reduce ISI. 
  3) Spread Spectrum - Spreading the signal over a wide frequency band to reduce the impact of fading on any particular frequency component.

This experiment focuses on channel equalization and introduces two primary equalization techniques: 
  1) Zero Forcing (ZF) and
  2) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizers.

These methods are implemented to mitigate ISI, and each has distinct characteristics in terms of handling noise and channel response.

## Zero Forcing (ZF) Equalizer

The Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer is a fundamental technique designed to completely eliminate the impact of the channel on the received signal. It achieves this by applying a filter that is the inverse of the channelâ€™s frequency response. Mathematically, the ZF equalizer is defined by a filter 
```math
     W_{ZF} = H^{-1} 
```
where, H represents the channel matrix.

By inverting the channel, the ZF equalizer restores the transmitted signal by "forcing" the effect of the channel to zero. However, this approach has a significant drawback: when the channel gain is small or near zero, the ZF equalizer amplifies the noise in the received signal. This issue is particularly problematic in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where ZF equalization can lead to poor Bit Error Rate (BER) performance.

## Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Equalizer

The Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizer is designed to optimize signal recovery by balancing the trade-off between ISI mitigation and noise amplification. Unlike the ZF equalizer, the MMSE equalizer does not completely negate the channel's impact; instead, it minimizes the mean square error between the transmitted and estimated symbols. The MMSE filter is given by
```math
   W_{MMSE} = \left(H^HH + \sigma_n^2I\right)H^H
```
where $\sigma_n^2$ is the noise variance.

The MMSE equalizer provides a better balance between suppressing ISI and controlling noise amplification, yielding improved BER performance across a wide range of SNR levels. By optimizing for minimum mean square error, this equalizer achieves a higher output SNR compared to ZF, especially in challenging channel conditions.

## Comparative Performance of ZF and MMSE Equalizers

In this experiment, we will compare the ZF and MMSE equalizers by implementing them and observing their performance across different SNR conditions. The ZF equalizer will illustrate the effect of noise amplification, particularly in low SNR, while the MMSE equalizer will demonstrate better BER performance by minimizing the impact of noise. Through this comparison, the experiment aims to highlight the trade-offs involved in selecting equalization techniques for wireless communication systems.
