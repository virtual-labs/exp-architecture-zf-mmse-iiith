AWGN channel..narrow band wireless channel..phase shift elimination...the same effect happend even in WB...


In wideband wireless communication, a fundamental challenge is frequency-selective fading, which occurs when delay spread of the wireless channel is significantly larger compared to the symbol duration. As the symbol duration is inversely related to the bandwidth, the wideband signal usually undergoes frequency-selective fading that leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI). Basically, the superposition of multiple copies of the signal recieved through multipath with larger delay spread becomes overlapping symbols in time which essentially contributes to ISI. This results in a significant degradation in the performance of the communication system by causing errors in symbol detection.

To address ISI in frequency-selective fading channels, several techniques are commonly employed, including:
  1) **Channel Equalization** - The equalizers are used on the reciever side to reverse the effects of the channel and recover the transmitted signal. 
  2) Multi-Carrier Modulation - Splitting the wideband channel into multiple narrowband subcarriers. 
  3) Spread Spectrum - Spreading the signal over a wide frequency band to reduce the impact of fading on any particular frequency component.

In this experiment, we study the ISI removal through channel equalization. The following diagram shows equalizer equipped MIMO systems for narrowband communication.

The signal arriving at the reciever can be modeled as

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the transmitted symbol vector and $n$ is the awgn noise.

This experiment focuses on channel equalization i.e removing the effect on $\mathbf{H}$ on the recieved signal so that it becomes decodable. To do this, we will now describe the two popular equalization techniques: 
  1) Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer and
  2) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizer.

These methods are implemented to mitigate the channel impact, and each has distinct characteristics in terms of handling noise and channel response.

## ZF Equalizer

ZF equalizer is a fundamental technique designed to completely reverse the impact of the channel on the received signal. It achieves this by applying a filter that is the inverse of the channelâ€™s frequency response. Mathematically, the ZF equalizer is defined by a filter 

$$
\begin{aligned}
     W_{ZF} = \mathbf{H}^{-1}. 
\end{aligned}
$$

The recieved signal after ZF equalization reduces to

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \hat{\mathbf{y}} = W_{ZF}\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{H}^{-1}\mathbf{n}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The ZF equalizer restores the transmitted signal by "forcing" the effect of the channel to zero on desired component. However, we can observe from the above equation that this approach has a significant drawback: when the channel gain is small or near zero, the ZF equalizer amplifies the noise component in the received signal. This issue is particularly problematic in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes. Thus ZF equalizer usually has poor bit error rate (BER) performance in low SNR regimes. To combat for this, we move to understand MMSE equalizer.

## MMSE Equalizer

MMSE equalizer is designed to optimize signal recovery by balancing the trade-off between channel inversion and noise amplification. Unlike the ZF equalizer, the MMSE equalizer does not completely negate the channel's impact; instead, it minimizes the mean square error between the transmitted and estimated symbols. The linear MMSE filter is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
   W_{MMSE} = \left(H^HH + \sigma_n^2I\right)^{-1}H^H,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\sigma_n^2$ is the noise variance.

The MMSE equalizer provides a better balance between channel inversion and noise amplification by scaling the recieved signal with $$. Because of this scaling, the SNR of the equalized and originally recieved signal remain unchanged. However, it is interesting to note that when chnannel is poor (i.e $H^HH$ \approx 0), the term  $\sigma_n^2I$ will restrict the noise amplification. On the contrary, when channel is good (i.e $H^HH$ >> $\sigma_n^2I$), MMSE equalizer reduces to ZF equalizer. Thus, we observe that MMSE provides additional benefits in low SNR regime while performing on par with ZF under good channel conditions.


## Comparative Performance of ZF and MMSE Equalizers

In this experiment, we will compare the ZF and MMSE equalizers by implementing them and observing their performance across different SNR conditions. The ZF equalizer will illustrate the effect of noise amplification, particularly in low SNR, while the MMSE equalizer will demonstrate better BER performance by minimizing the impact of noise. Through this comparison, the experiment aims to highlight the trade-offs involved in selecting equalization techniques for wireless communication systems.
